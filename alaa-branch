after creating new repo i follow this steps to create new branch

to to list all the branches i have at frist
     $git branch
i will find that i have only one branch called main
so i will create 2 new branches called dev and test
      $git branch dev
      $git branch test
no to check the branches
      $git branch 
i will find the main branch and my 2 new branches dev and test
then i will switch to the dev branch 
      $git checkout dev
i will create new file and write to each of them
      $touch alaa-branch
      $touch alaa-deletebransh
then i will add this files to the staging area
      $git add .
then i will commit to local area
      $git commit -m "explain how to create,merage and delete branch"
then i will push the new branches to github
      $git push origin dev
      $git push origin test
to merage from main branch to dev and test branches
i will switch to the main branch
      $git checkout main
merage main with branches
      $git merage dev
      $git merage test
i could check the branches and list content of main branch to be sure all edit on dev and test is now on main too
      $git branch
      $git ls -a
now i will push the edits on the main branch
      $git push origin main
